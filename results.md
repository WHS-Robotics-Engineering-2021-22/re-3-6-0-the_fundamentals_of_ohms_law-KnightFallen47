I=3.3mA
R=V/I, R=5/3.32, R=1506
To find resistance of the LED, we take the resistor. So total resistance minus the resistor's resistance. So 1506 minus 1k equals 506 ohms of resistance for the LED.
I was correct about the LED by using the circut simulator app.
I changed the LED to the old default LED and the resistance went up from 506 to 570. So now the total is 1570 ohms.
I changed the resistance to 434 to get the 7.47 amps.
